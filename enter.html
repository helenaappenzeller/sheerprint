               <p>What is going on?<br>sheer prints have a translucent quality, which is unique. Hold up against the light the print will be illuminated, on top of an other print it will be see trough. Its qualities open up new possibilities for graphic design. Classical structures like the two page unit in editorial design can be broken up and new layers can be added. If you still love print in our digital age, and believe there is more printing to explore than ever, start sheer printing!</p>

               <p>How does it work?<br>For sheer prints you basically print wax on paper. Here you will find a method how you can apply the wax quite easily in your desired shape. This technic will first create wax paper which is then cut in your desired shape of print and later transferred to your poster or editorial by ironing. The wax paper is necessary to create a thin layer of wax, which will result in more exact prints and makes the wax less fragile to work with.</p>

                melt the paraffin in a big backing dish in the oven for 15min at 100Â°C. to protect you dish put a sheet of packing paper in it first <br><br>
                when the wax is completely melted, take the dish out and dip paper in the melted wax. make sure it is covered completely. it will take ca. 30s to cool down and dry then it is safe to lay on any surface without sticking to it.
